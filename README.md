# Customer Churn Epidemic

# Project Description

The phone company, Telco, is curious as to what is driving their churn rates. Taking a variety of features, I will be looking for correlation to narrow down the factors that might be driving customers to churn.

# Project Goal:

* Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
* Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
* Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?
