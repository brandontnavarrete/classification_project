# Customer Churn Epidemic

# Project Description

The phone company, Telco, is curious as to what is driving their churn rates. Taking a variety of features, I will be looking for correlation to narrow down the factors that might be driving customers to churn.

# Project Goal:

* Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
* Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
* Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

# Inital Thoughts and Questions

My initial hypothesis is that key variables will have a strong correlation to our target variable, churn, while others will have little to no correlation.

* Do people who use customer support churn more?
* Do people who pay more, whether monthly or total, churn more than those who pay less?
* Do older people churn more often than younger people?
* Does tenure length correlate in churn? Does longer tenure correlate to less churn?
